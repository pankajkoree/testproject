        1. Get closer to nature <br /> We all live with worries and fears,
        uncertainties, losses that leave us sad and pressures that make us feel
        stressed. Nature can have a really calming effect on us. <br /> We have
        been living around other animals and plants for thousands of years.{" "}
        <br /> Some people say nature helps them feel calmer, more hopeful and
        less alone. <br />
        Our research found that going for a walk was UK adults’ favourite way of
        coping with stress during the pandemic in 2020. <br /> In Japan, some
        people do “forest bathing”, which may improve their mental health.{" "}
        <br /> So going to a forest or wood and experiencing the different
        smells, sounds and textures may really help. <br />
        To get the best out of nature’s healing effects, try tuning your senses
        to what’s around you – the trees, plants, birds and animals, for
        instance, and water such as ponds or the seashore. Take a deep breath
        and see how you feel. The idea is to get connected with your natural
        surroundings.

        2. Get more from your sleep <br />
        Anyone who has struggled with sleep will know what a difference it makes
        to our bodies, minds and ability to cope with life. <br />
        We all have times when we sleep badly, and some of us live in situations
        that make a good night’s sleep impossible.
        <br />
        For many people, sleep is often the first thing that suffers when we're
        struggling with our mental health.
        <br />
        Adults need between 7 and 9 hours' sleep a night, including enough
        dreaming sleep and enough deeper sleep.
        <br />
        If you’re struggling with your sleep, think about trying a few simple
        changes.
        <br />
        For example: 1. Develop a relaxing bedtime routine to help you start
        winding down before you actually go to sleep <br />
        2. Avoid TV and mobile screens, alcohol and caffeine before bed. This
        will help you fall asleep and stay asleep. You could also avoid vigorous
        exercise before bed. <br />
        3. Go to bed and get up at around the same time every day, including
        weekends. <br />

        3. Keep moving <br />
        Our bodies and minds are connected, so looking after ourselves
        physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health (it
        works the other way around, too). <br />
        Moving our bodies – with sport, gardening, dancing, cycling, walking the
        dog, cleaning or going to the gym, for example – are great ways to
        improve our mental and physical health. <br />
        Exercise releases “feel good” hormones that reduce feelings of stress
        and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve
        our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a
        class or a group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental
        health. <br />
        We don’t have to be professional athletes, or sporty, to get the
        benefits of being physically active. From walking to dancing and
        basketball to the gym, the best exercise is simply the one we enjoy.{" "}
